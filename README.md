# Sunset - CSS Gradient Generator

This is an intuitive, flexible and performant tool for generating and sharing linear, radial and conic CSS gradients, developed with React.

It's purpose is to help front-end developers produce attractive and visually appealing color gradients by interacting with a simple UI and getting an automatically generated output code that can then be used in their own CSS codebase.

This tool offers a lot of flexibility that allows the application of almost every parameter permitted by CSS to let developers experiment and create beautiful gradients with less effort.

## Development summary

This project was developed using React.js at it's core, as it is a very powerful library that allows organized and predictable state management.
This technology is complemented by clean, organized and up to date code using a functional programming paradigm; alongside best practices for an optimal understanding and readability.

As code organization was a primary focus for development, Feature Slice Design was used as the architectural methodology of choice due to it's flexibility and ease of comprehension, making it suitable for this front-end project.

Performance was also a very important goal and, in order to be achieved, many aspects were optimized, such as memoization and prevention of unnecessary component re-renders. For this last, Zustand library was added as a dependency.
